# The Odin Project - CSS Practice Project for a landing page

This is the second project on The Odin Project, this time with the focus on designing a landing page and utilizing skills
learned in CSS so far. I am given two reference images on design, one for the page layout and another for the colors and
fonts that I am to use in said page layout.

End result aims to match the original design reference as closely as possible, with creative freedom to fill the page
content with a theme of personal choice.

After the project I have solidified my CSS skills on the following:

- Proper use of ID and class attributes, avoiding the overuse of ID's and !important keyword.

- Utilize multiple selectors when necessary while styling elements.

- Understand CSS Cascade, specificity and inheritance when combining multiple selectors and how it effects certain properties.

- Utilize Chrome Dev Tools and Google to troubleshoot complex layout issues.

- Use box models block and inline elements, breaking documents normal flow when necessary.

- Focus on flexbox techniques when needed and properly separate content in their respective containers using divs.

- Structure the page utilizing semantic HTML tags to provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience and demonstrate initiative to learn aspects of web development outside the imminent scope of the curriculum.
