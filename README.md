# The Odin Project - CSS Practice Project for a landing page

This is the second project on The Odin Project, this time with the focus on designing a landing page and utilizing skills
learned in CSS so far. I am given two reference images on design, one for the page layout and another for the colors and
fonts that I am to use in said page layout.

End result aims to match the original design reference as closely as possible, with creative freedom to fill the page
content with a theme of personal choice.

After the project I have solidified my CSS skills on the following:

- Proper use of ID and class attributes, avoiding the overuse of ID's and !important keyword.

- Utilize multiple selectors when necessary while styling elements.

- Understand CSS Cascade, specificity and inheritance when combining multiple selectors and how it effects certain properties.

- Utilize Chrome Dev Tools and Google to troubleshoot complex layout issues.

- Use box models block and inline elements, breaking documents normal flow when necessary.

- Focus on flexbox techniques when needed and properly separate content in their respective containers using divs.

- Structure the page utilizing semantic HTML tags to provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience and demonstrate initiative to learn aspects of web development outside the imminent scope of the curriculum.

# Update 26/03/2025 - Project Complete

The first iteration of the project is now complete. The finished product closely adheres the design specifications.
Next versions plan after progressing through the curriculum is to personify the page according to personal interests and possibly expand the page so,
header links lead to other pages.

While the project proved challenging in some regards, gathering information from the internet to get past the issues and reusing code from
other elements proved to be quite useful.

During the project I learned the following:

- This project had a heavy focus on flexbox usage, while gaining more experience in using it, I still feel mystified by the concept, requiring more learning in that regard.

- Used semantic HTML lightly throughout the page, with the page containing a header and a main divided by sections and a footer. More complex use of semantic HTML will be part of the curriculum later.

- Used Chrome Dev Tools to troubleshoot and Googled some issues using Flexbox. Major issue during the project was using flexbox with multiple elements, ending up using separate wrapper containers to fix issues such as background color given to body element from seeping through.

- Most of the elements throughout the project didn't use multiple selectors and I opted to utilize class selectors quite heavily, so issues with cascade and specificity wasn't really an issue in this project.

- Used inheritance at the end of the project to give the button a same color as the flex container, without need to copy values.

- Most other basic CSS concepts were quite easy so the flow on those was pretty straightforward.

For future reference, I should continue expanding my skillset and train more Flexbox, and positioning of the elements and wrapping elements properly. But for a second project I think my progression was great overall.
